The project aims to provide an e-commerce platform geared toward the Sri Lankan handicrafts sector, thereby allowing artisans to present their works and sell directly to buyers worldwide. Middlemen will be bypassed so artisans can make shareable digital content, and the entire process allows for fair pricing structures in favour of these artisans, thereby empowering them and keeping traditional craftsmanship alive.
Considerable progress has been made since the project started in identifying essential criteria, studying artisan problems, and creating a preliminary platform structure.
